## WIP Chess Engine In C

This is corn, a bitboard-based WIP chess engine built entirely in C. I hope to add bitboard-based move generation using  
the classical approach, as well as advanced search and evaluation features.

### Checklist:

[x] Board representation finished  
[x] Move making and undoing tested and working  
[ ] Move generation fully tested and working  
[ ] Evaluation function  
[ ] Search Function  
[ ] Optimizations, quiesence search / iterative deepening, pruning etc.
